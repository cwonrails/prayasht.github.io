I admit that it’s not the most common word so I don’t expect people to know what it means anyway. I stumbled upon it when I was looking for english translations of the Sanskrit word ‘jyoti’ which means light. This was around 2011 when I was in search of an alias to release my <a href=\"/music/\">music</a> with. Plus, it wasn’t taken by anyone else on SoundCloud! It’s stuck ever since and in many ways, it feels like it’s evolved to something much more than just a musical endeavor. I like to think of it as a pseudonym for creative output.</p>\n<p>My journey in art began when I was 7 years old. At that time, I was living in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/dRHoHcJc5WJ2\">Kathmandu, Nepal</a> (where I was born). My father bought me a water color set and some paint brushes for my birthday. I was hooked. Painting brought so much color to my life, literally. I looked forward to getting home from school every day so I could go crazy on the back pages of my school notebook. The nuances of the paint brush taught me a lot. It forced me to loosen my hands up and to avoid being stiff, and in many ways that taught me a lot about life. At some point, I got a set of color pencils and started outlining my paintings with them. That’s when drawing started to take precedence over painting. It was a nice break from all the splatter. I started being precise and bold with each stroke. It was the perfectly opposite thing for me to learn. I was so into it that I even got published on the local newspaper!</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-d039f.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 91.52892561983471%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Prayash Thapa Effulgence Art Newspaper\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-ec749.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-d894e.jpg 173w,\n/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-97c21.jpg 345w,\n/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-ec749.jpg 690w,\n/static/73f7a99bab0c8f41e75d1f9185aa5bf8-d039f.jpg 968w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<em>Look ma, that’s me!

I walked over to see a massive dreadnought guitar in his embrace. There was something about those steel strings ringing together that caught my attention.

I had always been the computer nerd in my family, so I thought why not? The bulky white box that dad brought home with a Windows 95 disc had me so engaged when I was a child, so I saw no harm in trying out something new. I learned programming by writing super basic programs and text-based games. One lecture specifically caught my attention: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cellular Automata</a>. Seeing a bunch of random pixels interact with their on-screen neighbors consciously based on a few basic rules lit up a different part of my brain. Such a simple algorithm with such an entrancing visual. Maybe I can still draw and paint, but use code as my brush?</p>\n<p>Well, no doubt. That’s when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of Computer Graphics. The revelation that I could still creatively express myself through code and make beautiful things turned my world upside down. It was the perfect definition of lazy man’s art. I define a simple set of constraints and let the computer pseudo-randomly run wild, yet somehow it can still produce something impressively artistic while I sit back and watch?

The styling would crap itself on mobile. Gave it a nice harsh white background (cringe). I hardcoded all the markup and CSS. None of the images were optimized. It was a bunch of <code>&#x3C;div></code> elements floating next to each other in the middle of nowhere which brought about some interesting layout challenges in CSS. The site loaded extremely slow because of all the external assets I was pulling. I also had the wonderfully brilliant idea of embedding a bunch of soundcloud players and rendering them in an <code>&#x3C;iframe></code> when you clicked on a specific link. All of this made sense for me at the time but it also resulted in a very choppy experience. Frankly, it was not even a fully realized website. It was a static landing page that just happened to have a bunch of links to other places.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a year or so and we arrive at v2:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-1addc.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 52.5%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"effulgence.io v2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-ec749.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-d894e.jpg 173w,\n/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-97c21.jpg 345w,\n/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-ec749.jpg 690w,\n/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\n/static/2f446cc6d55dd724daf702193d410652-1addc.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<em>Check it out live <a href=\"http://effulgence.io/v2\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Still not a full site. It’s a single page with a bunch of jQuery spaghetti handling clicks and hiding/showing things on cue. Regardless, I got more experience making other sites (and apps). v2 harnesses the power of inline SVGs, meaning my whole graphic is embedded into my page as a bunch of numbers that the browser knows how to draw. Working with SVG allowed me to be meticulous about the design. It gave me full control of the sizing, curvature of lines, relative placement of the blocks, all with added benefit of not having to write any custom CSS to achieve the same layout. And if I wanted to change something I could simply pop back into Illustrator, make my changes, and copy-paste the new numbers into my HTML. I embedded my navigation links wrapping the <code>&#x3C;path></code> tags of the SVG. And search engines would still crawl through it, because in the end, it’s all just markup. Brilliant, thank you W3C.</p>\n<p>You might have also noticed that v2 has an animation running in the back. Shortly after v1 and v2, I started spending more time exploring the realm of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding\">creative coding</a>. I started a project where I coded a graphic everyday for the year (I failed halfway through but that’s another story). But the 100+ pieces that I did do taught me a lot. It became clear to me that I needed to incorporate this into my website. And off I went trying to integrate a <code>&#x3C;canvas></code> element into my site because animations are cool. They add so much to the visual experience. I was an art-major.. of course I was going to add this to my site. Who am I kidding?</p>\n<p>v2 gave me a much clearer direction as to where I wanted my site to go. I was happy that I had something unique, and it had a cool animation with some content, but the experience wasn’t satisfying enough to me. I hated using some hacky jQuery just to get the single page application feeling, and I didn’t want to remake the whole thing using some hot new JavaScript framework that come out this morning to accomplish that. And I certainly didn’t want my whole page to be rendered dynamically on load, even though Google does index pages that use JavaScript to render their UI. I also wanted to start a blog, so I could post more content. Also the page had no sense of history, meaning that you were stuck on one page and could not navigate using the back and forward buttons. Not a good user experience. There had to be another way.</p>\n<p>I considered using Jekyll (a static site/blog generator), but I REALLY wanted the single page design to work. I did not want the page to refresh every time the user navigated to another page on the site. I wanted it to be a unified, cohesive experience from one part of the site to another, no jitters and no refreshes. The Web has come so far, why not utilize it to its fullest?</p>\n<p>After a lot of research, I ran into an awesome new framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\">gatsby.js</a>, a static site generator that transforms plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using React (an amazing library that lets you create functional UIs).

My trip was already off to a bad start with the weather-induced flight delay, and the last thing I wanted was to lose my stuff. I walked up to the baggage claim and expressed my concern (in Spanish) and immediately realized that I did not understand a single word that was spoken back to me. The accent was so thick, and with words blended together seamlessly, it sounded like a cacaophony of unrecognizable Spanish words layered with a heavy Italian accent. There goes my confidence. I asked to speak to someone in English and they promptly filed my claim. I hung around the airport waiting for my 5-hour bus ride to Rosario (~200km away).

He happily got out and made sure that someone was home expecting me. We rang the doorbell and my host mother cheerily popped her head out the window with excitement. The bus driver wished me luck and went on his way. The door opened and there she was, a short, jolly, middle-age woman with a sweet, raspy voice. She embraced me at first sight and welcome me. We clicked right away. She showed me my room, gave me a tour of her lovely house, and served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a refreshing glass of wine. We conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. She could not speak English, so lucky for me, I was forced to speak in Spanish the whole time. She spoke slowly and with clarity, which helped me understand her much better and also helped me regain my previously lost confidence in my Spanish skills. I got extremely lucky with my host mom, she was everything I wanted. While I was bummed that I didn’t have a perfect family to live with, I was gifted with the hospitality of the most affectionate and amiable host-mom I could asked for. We developed an incredibly strong bond, and every single night of dinner consisted of lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from adversity, love, family, dreams, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness and spirituality amongst other things.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1749},"end":{"line":18,"column":1630,"offset":3378},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1749},"end":{"line":18,"column":1630,"offset":3378},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"html","title":null,"url":"./patio.jpg","alt":"Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":3380},"end":{"line":20,"column":45,"offset":3424},"indent":[]},"value":"\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-d894e.jpg 173w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-97c21.jpg 345w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg 690w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    "},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe view from the backyard.","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":45,"offset":3424},"end":{"line":21,"column":28,"offset":3452},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":3380},"end":{"line":21,"column":28,"offset":3452},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Rosario is a beautiful city.

On arrival, while waiting for my luggage, it slowly dawned upon me that there was something amiss. My baggage had been mishandled and was stuck in Texas along with a thousand others. My trip was already off to a bad start with the weather-induced flight delay, and the last thing I wanted was to lose my stuff. I walked up to the baggage claim and expressed my concern (in Spanish) and immediately realized that I did not understand a single word that was spoken back to me. The accent was so thick, and with words blended together seamlessly, it sounded like a cacaophony of unrecognizable Spanish words layered with a heavy Italian accent. There goes my confidence. I asked to speak to someone in English and they promptly filed my claim. I hung around the airport waiting for my 5-hour bus ride to Rosario (~200km away). During this time, I also got to experience my first meal in Argentina: McDonalds. And so began the long ride to Rosario.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-babde.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.45833333333333%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"La casa de Pueyrrédon\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-ec749.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-d894e.jpg 173w,\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-97c21.jpg 345w,\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-ec749.jpg 690w,\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-babde.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \nHome for the next 5 weeks.</p>\n<p>I arrived late at night in Rosario with my phone dead and an address of my host family’s home. The bus driver let me know that we had arrived at my destination. I asked him to assist me in finding the exact door since it was my first time in the country and I’m a student with an assigned home. He happily got out and made sure that someone was home expecting me. We rang the doorbell and my host mother cheerily popped her head out the window with excitement. The bus driver wished me luck and went on his way. The door opened and there she was, a short, jolly, middle-age woman with a sweet, raspy voice. She embraced me at first sight and welcome me. We clicked right away. She showed me my room, gave me a tour of her lovely house, and served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a refreshing glass of wine. We conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. She could not speak English, so lucky for me, I was forced to speak in Spanish the whole time. She spoke slowly and with clarity, which helped me understand her much better and also helped me regain my previously lost confidence in my Spanish skills. I got extremely lucky with my host mom, she was everything I wanted. While I was bummed that I didn’t have a perfect family to live with, I was gifted with the hospitality of the most affectionate and amiable host-mom I could asked for. We developed an incredibly strong bond, and every single night of dinner consisted of lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from adversity, love, family, dreams, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness and spirituality amongst other things.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-d894e.jpg 173w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-97c21.jpg 345w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg 690w,\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \nThe view from the backyard.</p>\n<p>Rosario is a beautiful city.
